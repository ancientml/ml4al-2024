The 1st Workshop on Machine Learning for Ancient Languages (ML4AL 2024) will be co-located with ACL 2024 and will be held hybrid on August 15, 2024.

# The scope
Ancient languages preserve the cultures and histories of the past. 
However, their study is fraught with difficulties, and experts must tackle a range of challenging text-based tasks, 
from deciphering lost languages to restoring damaged inscriptions, to determining the authorship of works of literature. 
Technological aids have long supported the study of ancient texts, but in recent years advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) 
and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled analyses on Ancient Languages on an unprecedented scale and in unparalleled detail. 
This shift is reminiscent of how scientific instruments such as microscopes and telescopes have contributed to the domain of Science. 
The ML4AL Workshop aims to inspire and support research momentum in the emerging field of ML for the study of ancient texts.

The written evidence of the Ancient World is multifaceted and expansive. 
We invite contributions tackling texts from the diverse corners of the globe, in any language, script or medium. 
We establish a chronological scope from the inception of writing systems in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt (3400 BCE) to the late first millennium CE (the conventional "end of ancient history"). 
Encompassing such a vast and fertile remit for ML applications, ML4AL is designed to facilitate and invigorate the ongoing collaborative momentum between ML and the Humanities, to foster a deeper understanding of our past. 
Indeed, ancient languages fall under the category of low-resource languages due to the scarcity of available linguistic data for modern analysis. 
These languages, therefore, offer a compelling case study for ML: their limited textual material, socio-cultural intricacies, evolving forms, and diverse transmission histories pose a significant challenge to conventional models.

# Submissions
We welcome long (8 page) and short (4 page) paper submissions on topics related to:
* Digitization: bringing textual sources to a high-quality machine-readable format (e.g., through HTR).
* Restoration: recovering missing text and reassembling fragmented written artifacts.
* Attribution: contextualising a document within its original geographical, chronological and authorial setting.
* Linguistic analysis: involving tasks such as POS tagging, text parsing, segmentation, representation learning, semantics, sentiment, language identification.
* Textual criticism: the process of reconstructing a text's philological tradition of textual transmission, including the tasks of stemmatology and intertextuality.
* Translation and decipherment: which aim to make a text's language comprehensible and interpretable to modern-day researchers.

We encourage researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, working on ancient languages, irrespective of their gender, ethnicity, nationality, or academic affiliations, including fellows tackling low-underrepresented and non-Westerncentric ancient languages.

## Instructions
We welcome long (8 page) and short (4 page) paper submissions, in PDF format, made through OpenReview or ARR.
Regular workshop papers, which are accepted, will be included in the workshop proceedings, but non-archival submissions are also welcome. 

* Regular workshop papers: Both long (8 pages) and short (4 pages) papers may have unlimited pages for references and up to 100 MB of supplementary materials (separately). Authors are strongly encouraged to submit their code for reproducibility. In the camera-ready version, one additional page of content will be given to address the comments received by the reviewers. All submissions should be completely anonymous to allow a double-blind review process and the papers should follow the [ACL template style](https://github.com/acl-org/acl-style-files). Each paper is expected to be reviewed by at least three reviewers. Selected accepted papers will be presented orally and the rest as posters.

* Non-archival submissions: Papers on relevant topics that have appeared or might appear in other venues (workshops, conferences, journals) are also welcome, which can be presented at the workshop but will not be included in the workshop proceedings. 

# Important Dates (Tentative)
* Direct paper submission deadline: April 24, 2024
* Notification of acceptance: May 29, 2024
* Camera-ready paper due: June 5, 2024
* Pre-recorded video due: June 12, 2024
* Workshop: August 15, 2024
All deadlines are 11:59 pm UTC -12h (“anywhere on Earth”)
