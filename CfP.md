- The 1st Workshop on Machine Learning for Ancient Languages (ML4AL 2024) will be co-located with ACL 2024 and will be held in a hybrid format on August 15, 2024.

------------------------
Topic and Content
------------------------
Ancient languages preserve the cultures and histories of the past. However, their study is fraught with difficulties, and experts must tackle a range of challenging text-based tasks, from deciphering lost languages to restoring damaged inscriptions, to determining the authorship of works of literature. Technological aids have long supported the study of ancient texts, but in recent years advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) have enabled  analyses on Ancient Languages on an unprecedented scale and in unparalleled detail. This shift is reminiscent of how scientific instruments such as microscopes and telescopes have contributed to the domain of Science. The ML4AL Workshop aims to inspire and support research momentum in the emerging field of ML for the study of ancient texts.

------------------------
The scope
------------------------
The written evidence of the Ancient World is multifaceted and expansive. We invite contributions tackling texts from the diverse corners of the globe, in any language, script or medium. We establish a chronological scope from the inception of writing systems in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt (3400 BCE) to the late first millennium CE (the conventional "end of ancient history"). Encompassing such a vast and fertile remit for ML applications, ML4AL is designed to facilitate and invigorate the ongoing collaborative momentum between ML and the Humanities, to foster a deeper understanding of our past. Indeed, ancient languages fall under the category of low-resource languages due to the scarcity of available linguistic data for modern analysis. These languages, therefore, offer a compelling case study for ML: their limited textual material, socio-cultural intricacies, evolving forms, and diverse transmission histories pose a significant challenge to conventional models.

------------------------
The objectives
------------------------
ML4AL is tailored to tackle four substantial targets:
* By showcasing the scientific opportunities at the intersection of the Humanities and ML, it offers a roadmap for this burgeoning interdisciplinary field.
* It emphasises the value and urgency of active collaboration between the specialists from both fields, to produce compelling and consequential research.
* It generates awareness among the scientific community of the risk posed by data-bias and digital colonialism, and emphasises the importance of standardised datasets, metrics and benchmarks. 
* Finally, it aims to spotlight promising directions for future endeavours within this field.

------------------------
Topics of interest
------------------------
* Digitization: bringing textual sources to a high-quality machine-readable format.
* Restoration: recovering missing text and reassembling fragmented written artifacts. 
* Attribution: contextualising a document within its original geographical, chronological and authorial setting.
* Linguistic analysis: involving tasks such as POS tagging, text parsing, segmentation, representation learning, semantics, sentiment, language identification.
* Textual criticism: the process of reconstructing a text's philological tradition of textual transmission, including the tasks of stemmatology and intertextuality.
* Translation and decipherment: which aim to make a text's language comprehensible and interpretable to modern-day researchers.

------------------------------
Submissions
------------------------------
We particularly encourage submissions which tackle low-data, underrepresented, non-Western ancient languages.
We will use OpenReview and we welcome ARR submissions. 

------------------------------
Diversity and Inclusion Statement
------------------------------
We welcome submissions from researchers and practitioners from diverse backgrounds, and seek contributions from individuals working in the field of Machine Learning for ancient languages, irrespective of their gender, ethnicity, nationality, or academic affiliations.
